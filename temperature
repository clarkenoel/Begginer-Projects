I set out to build a simple temperature converter in Python to get accustomed with the language.

It works as intedned giving accurate conversions from Farhenhite to Celsius and vica versa.

Although there are some features I want to add soon.
Like stopping the program when the user inputs anything oteher than a number into the prompt whcih I have'nt been able to do yet.

I might upload this to github just to get the hang of things with git and whatnot.

I'll come back to polish this project soon.
